# Profile Picture Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of profile picture functionality for the Vortex iOS app, including both backend and frontend components.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. New Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/profile/picture`
- **Location**: `api/routers/auth.py`
- **Authentication**: Requires Firebase ID Token
- **Content-Type**: `multipart/form-data`

### 2. Features
- **File Validation**: Supports JPEG, JPG, PNG, and GIF formats
- **Size Limit**: Maximum 5MB file size
- **Storage**: Files stored in `uploads/profile_pictures/` directory
- **Unique Naming**: Files named with user ID and UUID for uniqueness
- **Database Update**: Updates user's `profile_image_url` field

### 3. Static File Serving
- **Mount Point**: `/static` maps to `uploads/` directory
- **Configuration**: Added to `main.py` using FastAPI's StaticFiles
- **URL Format**: `/static/profile_pictures/{filename}`

### 4. Updated Models
- **UserResponse**: Added `profile_image_url` field
- **ProfilePictureResponse**: New response model for upload endpoint
- **AuthResponse**: Updated to include profile image URL where applicable

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. iOS App Updates

#### Models (`VoiceApp/Services/Models.swift`)
- Added `profile_image_url` to `UserResponse`
- Added `ProfilePictureResponse` model

#### API Configuration (`VoiceApp/Services/APIConfig.swift`)
- Added `uploadProfilePicture` endpoint

#### API Service (`VoiceApp/Services/APIService.swift`)
- Added `uploadImage` method for multipart form data uploads
- Supports image compression and proper MIME types

#### Auth Service (`VoiceApp/Services/AuthService.swift`)
- Added `profileImageUrl` @Published property
- Added `uploadProfilePicture` method
- Updated authentication flow to fetch profile image URL
- Profile image URL persists across app sessions

#### Profile View (`VoiceApp/Scenes/Profile/ProfileView.swift`)
- **Image Display**: Shows actual profile image if available, falls back to placeholder
- **Image Picker**: Integrated with iOS photo library and camera
- **Source Selection**: Action sheet to choose between photo library and camera
- **Upload Functionality**: Saves selected image to backend
- **Error Handling**: Shows success/error messages
- **Loading States**: Displays loading indicator during upload

#### Sidebar (`VoiceApp/Components/Sidebar/SidebarOverlay.swift`)
- Updated to display actual profile image in sidebar
- Falls back to placeholder if no image is set

### 2. iOS Permissions
- **Photo Library**: `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` added to Info.plist
- **Camera**: `NSCameraUsageDescription` already present (for video calls)

### 3. User Experience
- **Tap Plus Button**: Opens image source selector
- **Photo Library Access**: Requests permission on first use
- **Camera Access**: Available if device has camera
- **Image Editing**: Supports cropping and editing before upload
- **Real-time Updates**: Profile image updates immediately after upload
- **Persistence**: Profile image persists across app launches

## Technical Details

### 1. Image Processing
- **Compression**: JPEG compression at 80% quality
- **Format**: Converts to JPEG for consistent storage
- **Size**: Automatic resizing and optimization

### 2. Security
- **Authentication**: Firebase ID Token required
- **File Validation**: Type and size restrictions
- **Unique Filenames**: Prevents filename conflicts
- **User Isolation**: Users can only upload to their own profile

### 3. Performance
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking upload operations
- **Memory Management**: Proper image data handling
- **Caching**: AsyncImage handles image caching automatically

## Testing

### 1. Backend Testing
- Run the test script: `python test_profile_picture.py`
- Use Postman or curl to test with real authentication tokens
- Verify file uploads and database updates

### 2. iOS Testing
- Test on both simulator and real device
- Test photo library access permissions
- Test camera access (real device only)
- Test image upload and display
- Test persistence across app restarts

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Image Optimization
- **Thumbnail Generation**: Create smaller versions for different UI contexts
- **Progressive Loading**: Implement progressive JPEG loading
- **Image Caching**: Add custom caching layer for better performance

### 2. Additional Features
- **Image Filters**: Add basic image editing capabilities
- **Multiple Images**: Support for multiple profile pictures
- **Image History**: Track profile picture changes over time
- **Social Sharing**: Allow users to share their profile pictures

### 3. Backend Improvements
- **CDN Integration**: Use CDN for better image delivery
- **Image Processing**: Add server-side image optimization
- **Backup Storage**: Implement image backup and recovery

## Deployment Notes

### 1. Backend Deployment
- Ensure `uploads/` directory is writable
- Configure proper file permissions
- Consider using cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for production

### 2. iOS Deployment
- Verify Info.plist permissions are correct
- Test on various iOS versions and device types
- Ensure proper error handling for network failures

## Conclusion

The profile picture implementation provides a complete, user-friendly solution for users to customize their profiles. The implementation follows iOS design guidelines, includes proper error handling, and maintains security through Firebase authentication. The backend is designed to be scalable and secure, with proper file validation and storage management.

Users can now:
1. Tap the plus button on their profile picture
2. Choose between photo library and camera
3. Select and edit their desired image
4. Upload and save it as their profile picture
5. See their profile picture displayed throughout the app
6. Have their profile picture persist across app sessions

The implementation is production-ready and can be extended with additional features as needed.
